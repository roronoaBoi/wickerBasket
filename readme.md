# Welcome
Hello, and welcome to the wickerBasket repository. This is a repo Ro uses to upload various Python scripts.

## Purpose
Currently, Ro is using this repository to outline fundamentals of Python syntax, and using this as a holding spot for different excercises from Al Sweigart's "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python". That's pretty much it. May as well git good and keep it fresh...
